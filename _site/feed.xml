        <title>Welcome!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my first blog on the various new technologies that i keep stumbling upon in my daily routine. Would love to share these with everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So probably it would make sense if i really start off by saying how this blog came about. Iâ€™l briefly talk about about how i created this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iv been trying to blog for some time now, trying to share some insights that i get everyday. However i really couldnt get down to how to make this happen. Then i stumbled upon this.&lt;/p&gt;
